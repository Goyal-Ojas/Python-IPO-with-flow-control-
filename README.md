Background

You are a Human Resources manager in charge of calculating employee pay.

Tasks

Create a basic application that calculates the the gross and net pay for three employees working at your company. You can count on there only being three and always three employees. You should collect (as inputs) each employee's name, hours worked, and hourly rate (3 variables x 3 employees = 9 variables). Also collect the tax rate which will be the same for all employees. Finally, print out a nicely formatted table that looks something like the one provided in the MyEducator assessment description.

If the number of hours worked is more than 40, then the pay rate should be 1.5 times the amount entered. If the number of hours is more than 60, then the pay rate should be 1.6 times the amount entered. Find a way to use both an elif and nested if statement as you meet this criterion.

Requirements

Use bold (\033[1m), underline (\033[4m), and the color red (\033[91m) somewhere in the code
You do not need to write code that adds these values into a table data structure. Simply print out the headers and then print out the values one line at a time as they are added. Automatically print out the totals line once three rows of data have been entered.
